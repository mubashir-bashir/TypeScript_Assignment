// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// Version 1

let alienColor = "green"
if(alienColor=="green"){
    console.log("Congratulation you just earned 5 points for shooting the alien")
}
else{
    console.log("Congratulation You just earned 10 points ")
}

// Version 2

let alien_color = "pink"
if(alien_color=="green"){
    console.log("Congratulation you just earned 5 points for shooting the alien")
}
else{
    console.log("Congratulation You just earned 10 points ")
}
