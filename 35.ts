// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!


let animals =["Lion","Tiger","Leopard"]
for(let i=0;i<animals.length;i++){
    console.log(animals[i])
}
for(let i=0;i<animals.length;i++){
    console.log(`${animals[i]} is a apex predators, and remarkable prowess in its respective habitats.`)
}


console.log("All the above animals are Apex Predators")
