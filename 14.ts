// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList= ['Mubashir', 'Ali','Adnan']

guestList.forEach((guest)=>{
    console.log(`\nDear ${guest}, I'm organizing a dinner gathering and would be honored if you could grace us with your presence. Your company would make the evening special."`)
})
